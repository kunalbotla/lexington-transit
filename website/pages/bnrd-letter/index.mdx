# Bus Network Redesign in Lexington

This letter asks the MBTA for 30-minute or better service from the shared portions of routes 62 and 76, as it was pre-COVID, retain service to the High School and Center on the 76, and to extend the 77, from Arlington Heights to Lexington Center to connect us directly to Arlington Center, Porter Square, and Harvard Square. 

Please share this with your friends, family, and in your communities.

Sign the letter at: [https://airtable.com/shr0iuKFxLPSE2xZf](https://airtable.com/shr0iuKFxLPSE2xZf). We need people in and around Lexington; anyone impacted!
